Project Overview: Greeting Cards With React and Vite
Greeting Cards is a 'beginner-friendly' React project. It demonstrates some of the basic principles of component-based architecture with styling from Tailwind CSS. Users will see greeting cards that include a title and message with an associated image displayed in a simple, clean layout. A simple application comprising a navigation bar (Navbar) and a functioning card component (GreetingCard) shows how to structure a React application and pass on data using props.

Key Features
1. Navbar:
A minimal navigation bar with an app title; hence header-like.
2. GreetingCard Component:
A card that displays, dynamically, a title of the message and an image.
Styling using Tailwind CSS, for simplicity and better readability.
3. React Components:
Well-structured components (simple Navbar, GreetingCard, App) encourage re-usability and neat code.

Technology Stack
4. React: Building user interface with reusable components.
5. Vite: to create a fast and optimized development environment.
6.Tailwind CSS: to style the components by using minimal CSS.
7. Git & GitHub: To handle version control, it will host the repository for this project.

Discussion
Purpose & Learning Goals
The purpose of the project is to get hands-on experience using React while learning how to:

1. Structure the React Application into Modular Components.
2. Use Props to Pass Information and Manage Props to Dynamically Render Content.
3. Use Tailwind CSS to Create Responsive and Aesthetically Pleasing Designs.
4. Integrate static assets such as images into a React project. Link the project to GitHub for version controlling and collaborating.
